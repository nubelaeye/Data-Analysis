# The OS module in Python provides functions for interacting with the operating system.
# OS comes under Python’s standard utility modules. This module provides a portable way
# of using operating system-dependent functionality. The *os* and *os.path* modules include
# many functions to interact with the file system.

# 1. The Current Working Directory(CWD) as a folder, where the Python is operating.

# Whenever the files are called only by their name, Python assumes that it starts in 
# the CWD which means that name-only reference will be successful only if the file is in 
# the Python’s CWD.
# Note: The folder where the Python script is running is known as the Current Directory. 
# This is not the path where the Python script is located.
# To get the location of the current working directory os.getcwd() is used.

# 2. Changing the Current working directory

# To change the current working directory(CWD) os.chdir() method is used. This method 
# changes the CWD to a specified path. It only takes a single argument as a new directory path.

# 3. Creating a Directory
# There are different methods available in the OS module for creating a directory. 
# These are –
    # 1. os.mkdir()
    # 2. os.makedirs()

# Sample..
import os  
      
# Leaf directory  
# directory = "Dinosaur"
      
# Parent Directories  
# parent_dir = "C:/TestingOS"
      
# Path  
# path = os.path.join(parent_dir, directory)  
      
# Create the directory  
# 'Dinosaur'  
# os.makedirs(path)  
# print("Directory '% s' created" % directory)  

# Listing out Files and Directories with Python

# os.listdir() method in Python is used to get the list of all files and directories in
# the specified directory. If we don’t specify any directory, then the list of files and
# directories in the current working directory will be returned.

path = "/"
dir_list = os.listdir(path)  
  
print("Files and directories in '", path, "' :")  
  
# print the list  
print(dir_list)  

# Deleting Directory or Files using Python
# OS module proves different methods for removing directories and files in Python. These are – 

    # Using os.remove()
    # Using os.rmdir()

# Using os.remove()
# os.remove() method in Python is used to remove or delete a file path. This method can not
# remove or delete a directory. If the specified path is a directory then OSError will be
# raised by the method.

# Using os.rmdir()
# os.rmdir() method in Python is used to remove or delete an empty directory. OSError will 
# be raised if the specified path is not an empty directory.

# File name  
file = 'Testing.txt'
      
# File location  
location = "C:\Machine Learning/"
      
# Path  
path = os.path.join(location, file)  
      
# Remove the file  
# 'file.txt'  

# os.remove(path)  # This works.. 

directory = "Dinosaur"
      
# Parent Directory  
parent = "C:\TestingOS/"
      
# Path  
path = os.path.join(parent, directory)  
      
# Remove the Directory  
# "Geeks"  
# os.rmdir(path)  # This works..


#              * Commonly Used Functions
# 1. os.name: This function gives the name of the operating system dependent module imported.
# The following names have currently been registered: ‘posix’, ‘nt’, ‘os2’, ‘ce’, ‘java’ and
# ‘riscos’.

# 2. os.error: All functions in this module raise OSError in the case of invalid or 
# inaccessible file names and paths, or other arguments that have the correct type,
# but are not accepted by the operating system. os.error is an alias for built-in 
# OSError exception. 

fd = "GFG.txt"
  
# 3. os.popen() is similar to open() 
# This method opens a pipe to or form command. The return value can be read or written
# depending on whether the mode is ‘r’ or ‘w’. 
file = open(fd, 'w') 
file.write("Hello") 
file.close() 
file = open(fd, 'r') 
text = file.read() 
print(text)
  
# popen() provides a pipe/gateway and accesses the file directly 
file = os.popen(fd, 'w') 
file.write("Hello") 
# File not closed, shown in next function

# Closing the file is good pratice while left opened.
# 4. os.close() 
# Close file descriptor fd. A file opened using open(), can be closed by close() only.
# But file opened through os.popen(), can be closed with close() or os.close(). If we
# try closing a file opened with open(), using os.close(), Python would throw TypeError. 

# 5. os.rename(): A file old.txt can be renamed to new.txt, using the function os.rename().
# The name of the file changes only if, the file exists and the user has sufficient 
# privilege permission to change the file.

# Sample...

# fd = "GFG.txt"
# os.rename(fd,'Nw.txt') # This works..

# 6. os.remove(): Using the Os module we can remove a file in our system using the remove()
# method. To remove a file we need to pass the name of the file as a parameter. 

# 7. os.path.exists(): This method will check whether a file exists or not
# by passing the name of the file as a parameter. OS module has a sub-module
# named PATH by using which we can perform many more functions. 
# Let's confirm it with an example...

result = os.path.exists("Dinosaur.txt") #giving the name of the file as a parameter. 
print(result) # This works..

# * 8. os.path.getsize(): In this method, python will give us the size of the file in bytes. 
# To use this method we need to pass the name of the file as a parameter.

# sample..

size = os.path.getsize("Dinosaur.txt") 
print("Size of the file is", size," bytes.")

# All Done with the Basics...

# Now let's get into deep inside the computer memory space... Starting the * Advance! *.
# Let's get started...

# os.environ in Python is a mapping object that represents the user’s environmental variables.
# It returns a dictionary having user’s environmental variable as key and their values as value.

# os.environ behaves like a python dictionary, so all the common dictionary operations
# like get and set can be performed. We can also modify os.environ but any changes will be
# effective only for the current process where it was assigned and it will not 
# change the value permanently.

import pprint 
  
# Get the list of user's 
# environment variables 
env_var = os.environ 
  
# Print the list of user's 
# environment variables 
print("User's Environment variable:") 
pprint.pprint(dict(env_var), width = 1) 

# This is important sample for this function.. 
# Accessing a particular environment variable.
  
# Get the value of 
# 'JAVA_HOME' environment variable 
# using get operation of dictionary 
java_home = os.environ.get('JAVA_HOME') 
  
# Print the value of 
# 'JAVA_HOME' environment variable 
print("JAVA_HOME:", java_home) 

# How to modify it..
os.environ['JAVA_HOME'] = '/home / ihritik / jdk-10.0.1'

# Adding a new environment variable
# sample..
# Add a new environment variable  
os.environ['GeeksForGeeks'] = 'www.geeksforgeeks.org'
  
# Get the value of 
# Added environment variable  
print("GeeksForGeeks:", os.environ['GeeksForGeeks']) 

# os.chdir() method in Python used to change the current working directory to specified 
# path. It takes only a single argument as new directory path.
# In this function it has the current directory location name and then it changes it..

# os.getcwd() is used..
# To know the current working directory of the file, getcwd() method can be used.
# After changing the path, one can verify the path of current working directory using
# this method. 
cwd = os.getcwd()
 
# print the current directory
print("Current working directory is:", cwd)

# os.getenv() method in Python returns the value of the environment variable key if it exists
# otherwise returns the default value.

# Get the value of 'JAVA_HOME' 
# environment variable 
key = 'JAVA_HOME'
value = os.getenv(key) 
  
# Print the value of 'JAVA_HOME' 
# environment variable 
print("Value of 'JAVA_HOME' environment variable :", value) 

# os.get_exec_path() method in Python is used to get the list of directories that will
# be searched for a named executable while launching a process.

exec_path = os.get_exec_path() 
  
# Print the list 
print("Following paths will be searched for a named executable:") 
print(exec_path) 

# os.geteuid() method in Python is used to get the current process’s effective user id.

euid = os.getpid() 
print("Effective user ID of the current process:", euid) 

# os.access() method uses the real uid/gid to test for access to path. Most operations
# uses the effective uid/gid, therefore, this routine can be used in a suid/sgid 
# environment to test if the invoking user has the specified access to path. 

# Following values can be passed as the mode parameter of access() to test the following:

# "" os.F_OK: Tests existence of the path.
# os.R_OK: Tests readability of the path.
# os.W_OK: Tests writability of the path.
# os.X_OK: Checks if path can be executed. ""

#   Returns: True if access is allowed, else returns False.

# Assuming only read operation is allowed on file
# Checking access with os.F_OK
path1 = os.access("gfg.txt", os.F_OK)
print("Exists the path:", path1)
 
# Checking access with os.R_OK
path2 = os.access("gfg.txt", os.R_OK)
print("Access to read the file:", path2)
 
# Checking access with os.W_OK
path3 = os.access("gfg.txt", os.W_OK)
print("Access to write the file:", path3)
 
# Checking access with os.X_OK
path4 = os.access("gfg.txt", os.X_OK)
print("Check if path can be executed:", path4)

# os.chroot() method in Python is used to change the root directory of the current 
# process to path.
# I am not using this function because I don't want to change my current root directory.

# os.link() method in Python is used to create a hard link. This method creates a hard
# link pointing to the source named destination. 

# src = '/home/ihritik/file.txt'
 
# # Destination file path
# dst = '/home/ihritik/Desktop/file(link).txt'
# os.link(src, dst)
 
# print("Hard link created successfully")

#               Almost Most Common Functions Here....

# os.listdir() method in python is used to get the list of all files and directories in
# the specified directory. If we don’t specify any directory, then list of files and 
# directories in the current working directory will be returned.

path = os.getcwd() 
  
# Get the list of all files and directories 
# in current working directory 
dir_list = os.listdir(path) 
  
  
print("Files and directories in '", path, "' :")  
# print the list 
print(dir_list) 

# os.replace() method in Python is used to rename the file or directory. If destination
# is a directory, OSError will be raised. If the destination exists and is a file, 
# it will be replaced without error if the action performing user has permission. 
# This method may fail if the source and destination are on different filesystems.
file = "Dinosaur.txt"
 
# File location which to rename
location = "Dinosaur.txt"
# Path
path = os.replace(file, location)
# renamed the file f.txt to d.txt
print("File %s is renamed successfully" % file)
